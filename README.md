# linked-spending (development version)

This is a subset of the LinkedSpending dataset (LS package 2013-9), which contains government spending information from around the world. The dataset uses the [RDF Data Cube vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/). Only the spending observations were kept in this subset, extra contextual information was discarded. See the [website](http://linkedspending.aksw.org/) and the [paper](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj923.pdf) for more details.

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/linked-spending/dev).*

## Technical metadata

- **<abbr title="Inverse of stax:isUsageOf – indicates that the subject is related to a usage of an RDF stream type.

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
